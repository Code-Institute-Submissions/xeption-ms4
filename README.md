# User Experience & User Interface

## Purpose

The concept of my Full-Stack Development Milestone is to create an E-commerce shop selling jewellery.  

The purpose of this project is to create an e-commerce platform for a small business that is selling jewellery by categories ( necklaces, rings, earrings, etc..). 

This Project is demostrating not only the understanding of Django & Python and combines it with HTML, CSS & Javascript, but also is demonstrating the understanding of an authentication mechanism, a payment method provider (Stripe) and the use of a relational database.

The app was built using GitHub and deployed to Heroku, with all of static files stored with AWS.

## DESIGN 

### Research

![Research](https://i.ibb.co/hWK1VSV/Progetto-senza-titolo.png)

### Colour Scheme

* For this concept of XEPTION E-commerce, I decided to use Nude Colors that are really pleasing and minimalist for the eye. 

* "According to color psychology, the nude color infers sentiments of warmth, solace, and security. Itâ€™s frequently portrayed as usual, practical, and ordinary, yet this tone of brown likewise be modern and sophisticated." - Gotodesigno.com

* The combinations of colors that I used it's:  

**#F7D4C8**

**#000000**

**#FFFFFF**

### Logo

I decided to create a simple minimalistic Logo by using Homemade Apple font from Google Fonts, that allows to have an improved visual polish and professional appearance. 

### Typography

- Poppins, serif
- Homemade Apple, cursive (Used also for the Main Logo)
- Prata, serif
- FontAwesome - Icons

## Database

To store the models needed for the project I used a Relational Database. I used SQLite in development that is comes by default by Django and Heroku Postgres in production. 

Choosing a Relation Database it was a good choice because it doesn't require any complex structuring and querying process, it's flexible, it makes the data to be non-repetitive and it gives easy access to data.
